# District 7570 Conference Information App for Android
A project for a group a part of the [Fall 2017 CSC 313 Software Engineering class](https://svu-falin.github.io/csc313/) at [Southern Virginia University](http://svu.edu).

## About
This bulk of this class was working on a project, creating a solution, for a real sponsor. This project provided us as students to develop many skills and abilities.
As the [project overview](https://svu-falin.github.io/csc313/team-overview.html) page suggests: 
>Most students find this to be the most meaningful part of their CS education to this point because you get to work on a project that really matters to someone and will live beyond the teacher’s grade book.
>
>In addition, it exposes you to working with a team and learning to find solutions on the Internet to challenges as they arise—both critical components of real-world software development.

This class also provided the opportunity to learn many skills such as:
+ Effectively using Git
+ Working as a team
+ Communication through Slack
+ Following good software engineering principles
+ Using GitHub to manage our repository
+ Work with Android and Java

## Rotary District 7570
From [Rotary's website about page](https://www.rotary.org/en/about-rotary):
>Rotary is a global network of 1.2 million neighbors, friends, leaders, and problem-solvers who come together to make positive, lasting change in communities at home and abroad.

[Rotary District 7570](http://www.rotary7570.org/District/About) is one of the many organizations a part of Rotary International located around Virginia and Tennessee.

*District 7570 runs a conference yearly, and as with all conferences, communication between conference administrators and attendees can be difficult to manage. __This app's purpose is to solve that solution.__*
